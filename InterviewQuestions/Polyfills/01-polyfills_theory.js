/*
A Polyfill is a piece of code in JS that provides the functionality of modern features
on older browsers that do not natively support them. This allows developers to use modern JavaScript
features without worrying about whether all user's browsers support those features.

Backward Compatibility: Polyfills enable backward compatibility by allowing new features to work
                        on older browsers. For example, many modern JavaScript features introduced 
                        in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later, such as Promise, fetch, and Array.prototype.includes, 
                        are not available in older versions of Internet Explorer or other outdated browsers.

Implementation: Polyfills work by checking if the browser supports a particular feature.
                If not, the polyfill provides its own implementation of that feature. 
                This ensures that code relying on these features can still function correctly.

Conclusion: Polyfills are essential tools for web developers aiming to use modern JavaScript features
            while ensuring compatibility with older browsers. By providing fallback implementations, 
            polyfills help create a more consistent and reliable user experience across different environments.
